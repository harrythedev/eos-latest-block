# eos-latest-block

Get information about the latest block on the EOS testnet.

## Getting Started

### Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file at the project root with the following:
* `NODE_PATH=src/` (will allow for absolute imports into components relative to the `src` directory)

## Coming Up
* Style up the blockInfo table. https://www.pinterest.com/pin/186899453262098388/. (It will look nothing like that though, haha.)
* Add Copy button for copying block JSON to clipboard. Include tooltip.
* Provide user feedback on error retrieving block
* Loading indicator (part of button?)
